                            States develop public policies to address societal needs. The laws, regulations, and decisions they set impact every aspect of our lives. They determine the quality of infrastructure we have, the quality of public services we get, the dynamism of the private sector, and the coverage of the welfare system. These policies, when determined democratically, are more likely to represent the interests of society as a whole, and they deserve our attention.
                             <br/> <br/>
                 In Lebanon, however, policies have lost their “public” nature: They have been crafted by the political establishment for the elites, putting their own interest ahead of the public’s. This resulted in a co-opted public administration that is plagued by corruption, causing a myriad of crises that they are incapable of solving, deeply threatening society itself.
                            <br/> <br/>
                The foundations of sound policymaking lie in a well-researched and evidence-based vision that is representative of the interests of the broader public as well as an informed and empowered constituency that can act as an agent of change.
                            <br/> <br/>
                   This is why The Policy Initiative (TPI), a homegrown and independent think-tank, was founded in February 2021. At a time of the collapse of Lebanon’s socio-economic model, we endeavor to contribute to shaping that vision and empowering the public to demand a better alternative. In other words, our mission is to bring policies back to the people.

                            To fulfill this, TPI aims to critically and empirically assess existing policies and generate meaningful alternatives. We also seek to engage with like-minded entities to harness the immense political and intellectual energy that still exists in the country.
                             <br/> <br/>
                We also strive to reach as many constituencies as possible through various media. In the absence of a capable government, our main interlocutor is the public itself, including syndicates, labor unions, civil society organizations, and alternative political groups as well as the donor community.
                             <br/> <br/>
                  People are at center of our work. TPI’s five founders, Sami Atallah, Hala Bejjani, Karim Daher, Mona Fawaz, and Nizar Saghieh, have decades-long track records of research, activism, and fighting for a better Lebanon by pushing for better policies. They join TPI with their expertise and their own teams and institutions.

                 The team at TPI is diverse, young, skilled, and has worked together for years. Each team member boasts a deep knowledge of the topics we cover with their skillset and experience. Our team sets TPI’s agenda and constantly rethinks how policy is made, how narratives should be shaped, and what solutions can be adopted.
                             <br/> <br/>
                  Our fellows magnify and broaden TPI’s scope of knowledge with their expertise, methods, and cutting-edge research that will help our work in Lebanon. They are based all over the world and hail from numerous fields, including the social sciences, economics and finance, environment, law, public health, urban studies, and media, among many others.
                <br/> <br/>
                With the financial, economic, social, and intellectual collapse of the country, purposely pushed by Lebanon’s elite, now is the right time to provide an alternative course. And TPI is here for that.
